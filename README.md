**Enterprise-grade transactional storage engine with WAL, crash recovery, and indexing**

MiniDB-Engine is a systems project focused on building the core components of a durable
transactional database kernel. It implements page-based storage, write-ahead logging,
transaction management, crash recovery, and indexing structures suitable for banking,
FinTech, and infrastructure platforms. This project emphasizes correctness, durability,
and recoverability over UI and APIs.

Topics:
- Storage engine
- Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
- Crash recovery & deterministic replay
- Transaction lifecycle & atomicity
- Indexing & B+ Trees
- Systems design & architecture
